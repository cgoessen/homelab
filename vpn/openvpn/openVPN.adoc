= OpenVPN

Installing an openVPN server to administer and connect from the internet.

== Base install

Installing on xcp-ng.

Debian with packages:
```
ddupdate docker-compose docker.io
```

ddupdate is used to set up dynamic dns.

Installing with docker compose

== PostMortem

An electric outage caused the XCP cluster to reboot.

All VM including the one hosting the openVPN restarted without issue.

The openVPN container tried to restart but failed due to the presence of a sock file (to prevent concurrent starts).

While attempting to remove that lock and get the server to restart, it restarted as a first launch and reset all the configuration to factory.

I'm looking elsewhere for a more resilient solution.
