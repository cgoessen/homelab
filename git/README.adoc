= GIT

== Requirements/motivations

I need a self-hosted git server that will be independent of any container platform or virtual machine orchestrator.
This Git server will be used as a source of truth for the config of the above mentions.
Nevertheless, I believe it will be easier to have that server running as a container.

I want a solution that provides some runners for CI/CD.

That solution should be as lean as possible.
