NOTE: TODO move homeassistant on a dedicated machine, not using docker image. The current installation prevents some functionality (plugins...)

Installed with docker compose:

[source]

include::docker-compose.yaml[]

With the current installation (docker) some options are not available.
ESPHome allows us to flash and manage espHome devices
